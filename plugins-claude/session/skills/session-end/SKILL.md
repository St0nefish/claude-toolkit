---

Finalize the work: review, clean up commits, push, open a PR,
watch CI, and return to the default branch.

This is the **review-gated, worktree-aware** finalizer. It owns a
pre-PR code review gate, `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` issue linking, and worktree
teardown after merge. For a quick lifecycle with none of that —
just stage → commit → push → PR → watch → merge → return — use
`/git-tools:ship` instead. (`session-end` does not delegate to
`ship` because `ship` ends with `git checkout <default>`, which
fails from inside a worktree.)

### Steps

1. Gather current state:

   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/catchup
   ```

   Extract from the output:
   - `CURRENT` — the current branch name
   - `DEFAULT` — the default branch name
     (e.g. `master` or `main`)
   - `ON_BASE` — true if the current branch IS the
     default branch with no diverging commits

   If `ON_BASE` is true and there are no uncommitted
   changes, tell the user there is nothing to finalize
   and stop.

1b. Detect the platform once — every later hosted-CLI step in this flow
   branches on this value:

   ```bash
   PLATFORM=$(bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-wait platform)
   ```

   Check for an existing open PR for the current branch:

- **github:**

     ```bash
     PR_JSON=$(gh pr list --state open \
       --json number,title,headRefName,url \
       | jq --arg b "$CURRENT" '.[] | select(.headRefName == $b)')
     ```

- **gitea:**

     ```bash
     PR_JSON=$(tea pr list --state open --output json \
       --fields index,title,head,url \
       | jq --arg b "$CURRENT" \
         '.[] | select(.head == $b or (.head | split(":") | last) == $b)')
     ```

  If found, extract the PR URL and number, skip
  steps 3-7, and jump directly to step 8 (CI watch)
  using the existing PR info.

2. Check for uncommitted work. If found, ask the user
   via AskUserQuestion:
   - **Commit it** — stage and commit before proceeding
   - **Discard it** — `git restore .`
   - **Cancel** — abort the `end` flow

   If `ON_BASE` is true (working directly on the default
   branch), push the commit and skip to step 8 (CI watch).
   Steps 3-7 only apply to feature branches.

3. **Agent review** — use the `Agent` tool
   (`subagent_type: general-purpose`) to spawn a review
   agent with this prompt:

   > Review the changes on the current branch compared
   > to the default branch. Focus on:
   > 1. Does the code actually address the linked issue
   >    (if any)?
   > 2. Code quality: clarity, edge cases, error handling
   > 3. Test coverage: are the changes tested?
   > 4. Any obvious bugs introduced?
   >
   > Report findings concisely. Do not make changes —
   > report only.

   Use `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/catchup`
   output and `git diff <default>..<branch>` as context
   for the review agent.

4. Present the review findings to the user. Ask via
   AskUserQuestion:
   - **Looks good, open PR** — proceed
   - **I'll fix the issues first** — pause the `end`
     flow; user will re-invoke when ready
   - **Open PR anyway** — skip fixes and proceed

5. Determine whether the work is linked to an issue. Reuse the issue number from
   prior session context, an explicit `#N` in the user request, or existing
   commit/PR text when available. **Do not** parse it from the branch name — issue
   branches use `<type>-<slug>`. If no confident issue number is available, leave
   the PR unlinked. Build the PR body:

   ```markdown
   ## Summary

   <2-3 sentence description of what was done>

   ## Changes

   - <bulleted list of key changes>

   ## Testing

   <how this was tested or why no tests were needed>
   ```

   If a linked issue exists, append `Fixes #N` for bug/fix work or `Closes #N`
   otherwise to the PR body.

6. Create the PR. Get the default branch and open the PR, branching on
   `$PLATFORM` from step 1b — `tea pr create` has no `--body-file`, only
   inline `--description`:

   - **github:**

     ```bash
     DEFAULT=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name)
     BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
     cat > /tmp/pr-body.md << 'EOF'
     <PR body from step 5>
     EOF
     gh pr create \
       --title "<concise PR title>" \
       --head "$BRANCH" \
       --base "$DEFAULT" \
       --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
     rm -f /tmp/pr-body.md
     ```

   - **gitea:**

     ```bash
     DEFAULT=$(tea api repos/{owner}/{repo} | jq -r .default_branch)
     BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
     cat > /tmp/pr-body.md << 'EOF'
     <PR body from step 5>
     EOF
     tea pr create \
       --title "<concise PR title>" \
       --head "$BRANCH" \
       --base "$DEFAULT" \
       --description "$(cat /tmp/pr-body.md)"
     rm -f /tmp/pr-body.md
     ```

7. Confirm to the user: PR URL, linked issue (if any),
   and note that CI is being watched next.

8. **Watch CI** — poll the CI run for the current branch:

   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-wait \
     run watch --branch "$BRANCH"
   ```

   Parse the key:value stdout output (`status`, `url`,
   `duration`, `failed_jobs`). Then:
   - **`pass`** — continue to step 8b
   - **`fail`** — show the failed jobs and log excerpt
     (printed to stderr by `run watch`). Ask via
     AskUserQuestion:
     - **Fix it** — pause the `end` flow; user will
       address failures and re-invoke
     - **Ignore** — continue to step 8b
   - **`no-workflow`** — note that no CI workflow was
     found; continue to step 8b
   - **`timeout`** — ask via AskUserQuestion:
     - **Wait longer** — re-run `run watch` with
       `--initial-delay 0` and a longer `--timeout`
     - **Continue** — proceed to step 8b

8a. **Check auto-merge** — only when step 8 returned
   `pass` and `ON_BASE` is false. There is no `pr auto-merge-status`
   command; check it directly, and only on GitHub — Gitea has no auto-merge
   feature at all:

- **github:**

     ```bash
     AUTO_MERGE=$(gh pr view "$CURRENT" --json autoMergeRequest \
       --jq '.autoMergeRequest != null')
     ```

  If `true`, note to the user that auto-merge is enabled and the PR will
  merge automatically.

- **gitea:** skip this check. Note to the user instead that the `pr wait`
  in step 8b is waiting on a human to click merge, not a bot — Gitea has
  no auto-merge.

8b. **Wait for merge** — skip this step if `ON_BASE` is
   true (direct-to-default pushes have no PR to wait on).
   Otherwise, poll until the PR merges:

   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-wait \
     pr wait --branch "$CURRENT"
   ```

   Parse the key:value stdout output (`status`,
   `pr_number`, `url`, `duration`). Then:

- **`merged`** — continue to step 9
- **`closed`** — ask via AskUserQuestion:
  - **Return to default branch** — continue to step 9
  - **Investigate** — pause the `end` flow for the
    user to investigate
- **`blocked`** — ask via AskUserQuestion:
  - **Fix conflicts** — pause the `end` flow for the
    user to resolve conflicts and re-invoke
  - **Skip wait** — continue to step 9
- **`timeout`** — if auto-merge was detected in
  step 8a, automatically re-run `pr wait`
  (up to 2 retries, no prompt).
  If auto-merge was NOT detected, ask via
  AskUserQuestion:
  - **Wait longer** — re-run `pr wait` with a
    longer `--timeout`
  - **Return now** — continue to step 9
- **`no-pr`** — note that no PR was found;
  continue to step 9

9. **Return to the main checkout / default branch:**

   - **If this session is in a worktree** (entered via
     `EnterWorktree` this session): call `ExitWorktree`. Use
     `action: remove` **only** when the PR merged (step 8b
     returned `merged`) — this returns to the main checkout
     and deletes the now-merged worktree and branch.
     Otherwise use `action: keep` to preserve the work. If
     `remove` reports uncommitted changes or unmerged
     commits, fall back to `keep` (or confirm with the user
     before re-invoking with `discard_changes: true`). Then
     run `git pull` in the main checkout.
   - **If `ExitWorktree` reports no active worktree session**
     (the worktree was created in an earlier session): `cd`
     to the main worktree root (first entry of
     `git worktree list`), then — only if merged — run
     `git worktree remove <path>` and `git branch -d <branch>`.
   - **Otherwise** (in-place branch):

     ```bash
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/branch default \
       && git pull
     ```

   Skip if already on the default branch in the main checkout.

10. **Final summary** — present to the user:
    - PR URL (if created)
    - CI status (pass/fail/no-workflow/timeout)
    - Current branch (should be the default branch now)
    - Linked issue (if any)

### Notes

- Do NOT open the PR earlier — PR creation triggers
  CI and merge pipelines
- WIP commits in the branch are fine; squashing is
  optional (not forced)
