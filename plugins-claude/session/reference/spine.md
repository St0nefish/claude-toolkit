# Begin-work spine

The shared playbook for the lightweight session entrypoints (`session-start` and
`session-issue`). Both doors differ only in **how the work is chosen** — once the
work is identified, they run these phases identically. This is the single-session
counterpart to `session-orchestrate`: same shape (isolate → explore → plan →
hand-off), without the multi-agent execute/review tail.

> **CRITICAL**: You MUST drive this through to a plan. After the branch exists you
> launch research agents and enter plan mode. NEVER print "suggested first steps"
> or ask "ready to start?" — the flow does not end until you have called
> `EnterPlanMode` with a plan built from real code exploration.
>
> **EQUALLY CRITICAL — the other end of the flow**: after the approved work is
> implemented you **STOP** (Phase 5) and wait for the user. You never commit, push,
> open/merge a PR, or finalize on your own. Plan approval ≠ permission to publish.

## Inputs (supplied by the calling door)

The calling skill has already established:

- **Context** — a freeform description (from `session-start`) and/or a linked issue
  with its full title, body, and labels (from `session-issue`).
- **Base branch name** — `<type>-<slug>` when an issue is linked, or
  `wip-<slug>` for freeform work. The branch does not carry the issue number; the
  linkage is the PR's `Closes #N`.

If you reach this spine without a base name or any context, stop and return to the
calling door — it owns target selection.

## Phase 1 — Isolate

Decide whether to isolate the new branch in a git worktree. **Skip this phase
entirely** when resuming an existing branch, or when already inside a worktree
(`git rev-parse --git-common-dir` resolves outside `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`,
or `git worktree list` shows you are not in the main worktree) — just proceed on the
current checkout.

**Default to a worktree for substantial new work** — it keeps the main checkout
clean and lets parallel sessions coexist. Lean toward a worktree when any hold: the
current branch has uncommitted changes that would be disturbed, the user asked for
parallel/isolated work, or the work is a non-trivial feature. Create the branch
**in place** for trivial one-file fixes, or if the user prefers the current checkout.
If genuinely unsure, offer the choice via `AskUserQuestion` (Worktree / In place).

**In place:**

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/branch create <base-name>
```

**Worktree:**

1. **Provision dependencies first (one-time per repo).** A fresh worktree is a clean
   checkout — gitignored build artifacts and deps don't carry over, and native
   provisioning only runs at creation time, so configure it **before** creating the
   worktree. Detect heavy gitignored directories present:

   ```bash
   for d in node_modules .venv venv target build dist .next vendor .gradle .tox; do
     [ -e "$d" ] && git check-ignore -q "$d" && echo "$d"
   done
   ```

   If any are found and not already in `worktree.symlinkDirectories`, offer via
   `AskUserQuestion` to write them to that key in the **project** `.claude/settings.json`,
   and to add common local files (`.env`, `.env.*`) to a root `.worktreeinclude`. Ask
   before writing; only touch project-level config, never global. Recommended shape:

   ```json
   { "worktree": { "symlinkDirectories": ["node_modules", ".venv"] } }
   ```

2. **Create + enter the worktree:** call `EnterWorktree` with `name` set to the
   base name (already in dash form — `<type>-<slug>` or `wip-<slug>` — so it needs
   no conversion and contains no `/`). This creates branch `worktree-<name>`, runs
   native provisioning, and switches the session into the worktree. Do **not** also
   run `branch create` — `EnterWorktree` creates the branch. (The `worktree-` prefix
   is expected and harmless.)

## Phase 2 — Escalate to orchestrate? (gate)

Before exploring, judge whether the work is substantial enough to warrant the
heavier `/session:session-orchestrate` workflow (multi-agent dispatch, model
tiering, an automated review pass). **Lightweight is the default, and most work
stays lightweight.** Do not surface this choice on every run — a needless
lightweight-vs-orchestrate menu on routine work is the exact thing to avoid. Your
first job is to decide *whether the question is even worth asking*, and only ask
when the answer is genuinely "this is a big task."

**Step 1 — Assess scope yourself** from everything you already know (the freeform
description and/or the issue title, body, and labels). Read it as *complex* only
when **two or more** of these signals hold:

- touches multiple files, modules, or subsystems; a cross-cutting concern
- real design ambiguity — more than one viable approach, or the approach is unclear
- correctness-critical or security-sensitive path where being wrong is expensive
- a long or multi-part spec: ≳300-word body, several acceptance criteria/checkboxes
- keywords like `refactor`, `redesign`, `architecture`, `migration`, `system`, or a
  multi-step `feature`

**Step 2 — Act on the assessment:**

- **Simple or moderate work** (the common case — a bug fix, a single contained
  feature, a doc change, a scoped edit, anything where the path is reasonably
  obvious): **do not ask and do not mention orchestrate.** Assume lightweight and
  continue straight to Phase 3.
- **Genuinely complex work** (two or more signals above): ask **once** via
  `AskUserQuestion`:
  - **Stay on lightweight flow** — continue to Phase 3 here.
  - **Escalate to orchestrate** — invoke `/session:session-orchestrate` with the
    issue/description as context. The branch (and worktree, if created) is already
    set up, so orchestrate proceeds in this checkout. Do NOT run Phases 3-4 below.

If you ask and the user escalates, hand off and stop. Otherwise — whether you
skipped the question or the user chose to stay — continue to Phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Explore the codebase (MANDATORY)

> You MUST complete this phase. Do NOT stop after Phase 1/2. Do NOT print
> "suggested first steps".

Launch **2-3 research agents in parallel** in a single message. Use `Agent` with
`subagent_type: research`. Every agent prompt MUST include the full context — the
issue title/body/labels and/or the freeform description — so the agent can work
without seeing this conversation. Pick 2-3 angles based on what the work describes:

- **Locate the code** — find the files, functions, types, or modules implied by the
  work. Read them fully. Report what each does, the change point, and relevant
  surrounding signatures.
- **Find tests and related config** — existing test coverage of the affected area,
  related config, CI setup, docs. Report what exists, what's missing, how the suite is
  structured.
- **Trace the data/call flow** — follow the call chain or data flow through the area.
  Report entry points, intermediate steps, dependencies, and edge cases.

If an agent needs the issue tracker or repo API, use `gh` or `tea` directly —
detect the platform first with `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-wait
platform`, then branch on the result. `git-wait` itself is for two things
only — blocking until a PR merges (`pr wait`) or CI finishes (`run watch`) —
it is not a CLI wrapper, so everything else (listing, creating, commenting,
merging, closing, viewing logs) goes straight to `gh`/`tea`.

`gh` and `tea` diverge in ways that repeatedly trip agents up:

- **PR body**: `gh pr create` takes `--body-file -` (stdin) or a real file
  path; `tea pr create` has no `--body`/`--body-file` at all — only
  `-d`/`--description` with inline text (`--description "$(cat FILE)"` to
  pull from a file).
- **PR state values**: `gh pr list --state` accepts
  `open|closed|merged|all`; `tea pr list --state` only accepts
  `open|closed|all` — a merged PR reports state `closed`. To tell merged
  from closed on Gitea: `tea api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/N | jq -r
  .merged`.
- **Auto-merge**: `gh pr merge --auto` enables it, and `gh pr view N --json
  autoMergeRequest --jq '.autoMergeRequest != null'` checks it. Gitea has no
  auto-merge at all — a `pr wait` on Gitea is waiting on a human to click
  merge, not a bot.
- **CI run listing**: `gh run list --branch B` filters server-side and just
  works. `tea actions runs list --branch` is unreliable (Gitea leaves
  `head_branch` empty on `pull_request`-triggered runs) and `tea actions runs
  view` ignores `--output json` and prints a human table — use `tea api
  repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs` (and `.../actions/runs/ID/jobs`)
  instead.

## Phase 4 — Plan (MANDATORY)

> You MUST complete this phase. Do NOT stop after Phase 3.

Call `EnterPlanMode`. Using the agents' findings, produce a concrete implementation
plan with all of these sections:

### Changes

- The specific files and line ranges to change.
- What each change does and how — describe the actual code change, not "fix the bug".

### Testing (REQUIRED)

- What tests to add or update — unit, integration, or script-level as fits the
  codebase. Use the project's existing framework/runner; if none, add lightweight
  validation proportional to the change.
- Only skip tests if the change is purely cosmetic (comments, docs, formatting) —
  otherwise tests are mandatory.

### Risks & open questions

- Edge cases, breaking changes, unknowns.

### Post-implementation hand-off

- The plan MUST state that, once the work is implemented, you will run the mandatory
  STOP gate in Phase 5 below: present a summary plus caveats and wait for the user. Do
  **not** describe committing, pushing, or opening a PR as part of "the plan" — those
  are a separate, user-initiated step that happens only after the Phase 5 hand-off.

Present the plan for user approval before any implementation begins.

## Phase 5 — STOP & hand off after implementation (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)

> **HARD STOP.** The moment the planned work is implemented, you STOP and hand back to
> the user. You do **NOT** `git commit`, `git push`, open or merge a pull request,
> enable auto-merge, or invoke `/git-tools:ship` or `/session:session-end` on your own
> — **no matter how obvious the next step seems, no matter that the user approved the
> plan, and even if this skill was auto-invoked.** Approving the plan authorizes
> *implementation only*, never publication. Finalizing is a separate, explicit,
> user-initiated act. There is no exception to this; do not rationalize one.

When the work is done:

1. Do **NOT** call `AskUserQuestion` (no menu) and do **NOT** commit / push / PR /
   merge. Print a plain-text wrap-up, then wait for the user's free-text reply in the
   normal chat input. The wrap-up MUST contain, in this order:
   - **Summary** — one-line outcome plus a per-file list of what changed.
   - **Current state** — branch name, what is committed vs. still uncommitted, and
     test/build status (say so plainly if tests were not run).
   - **Caveats** — be up front and specific about known *or potential* problems:
     known bugs, uncovered edge cases, assumptions you made, incomplete pieces, and
     follow-up work. If you are unsure something works, say so explicitly. Do not
     downplay or omit risks to make the result look finished.
2. Then let the user decide what is next — they may run `/git-tools:ship`
   (commit → push → PR → watch → merge), `/session:session-end` (the review-gated PR
   flow), ask for changes, or finalize by hand. If an issue is linked and they later
   commit or open a PR, include `Closes #N` (or `Fixes #N` for bugs) so the issue
   auto-closes on merge.
3. If this run created a worktree, note that teardown is deferred: `/session:session-end`
   removes it after the PR merges, or the user can exit later with `ExitWorktree`. Do
   not tear it down here.
