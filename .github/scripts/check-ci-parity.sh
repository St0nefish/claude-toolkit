# check-ci-parity.sh — assert validate-all.sh runs everything CI runs.
#
# validate-all.sh is documented as the single local equivalent of CI. That claim
# is only true if the two lists agree, and a comment asking humans to keep them
# in step is exactly the kind of thing that silently rots — CLAUDE.md claimed
# "four checks" while CI ran five, and the missing one had no local equivalent
# at all. This turns that convention into a check.
#
# Compares the check commands in .github/workflows/ci.yml against the
# run_check lines in validate-all.sh. Setup steps (installing jq, rumdl) are
# not checks and are ignored.
#
# Usage: bash .github/scripts/check-ci-parity.sh
